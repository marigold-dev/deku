(** Calculates whether to start sending a new state root hash.\n\n\
        The state root epoch is the interval (in blocks) between state root\n\
        hash updates. Thus, a new epoch is triggered by applying a block with\n\
        a new state root hash. The block producer decides when to send\n\
        blocks with new state root hashes. To enforce that he does so on time,\n\
        validators reject blocks with updates that occur to soon or too late\n\
        (see [Protocol.apply]).\n\n\
        The block producer uses this function to determine when to send a\n\
        block with an updated state root hash *)
