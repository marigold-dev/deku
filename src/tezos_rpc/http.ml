(* The two functions below, make_lazy_lexbuf and lazy_json_from_stream
   exists to provide a way to continuously transform an string Lwt_stream into
   Yojson.Safe.t Lwt_stream.

     To achieve that we're using of OCaml 5.00 algebraic effects,
   as it allows to pause any function.

     In more details, every time something tries to read from this lexbuf
   if the internal buffer is empty, it will dispatch a `Poll_data` effect,
   which will have its continuation stored and resumed when `feed` is called.
   As Yojson.Safe.read_json tries to read from this lexbuf, it will stops as
   soon as there is not enough data available in the buffer and only be
   resumed when `feed` is called, `feed` is then driven by an string Lwt_stream.
