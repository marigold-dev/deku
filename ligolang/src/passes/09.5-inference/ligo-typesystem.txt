(** Ligo language version ++ 

This file present a formal description of the Ligo language

The typesystem features :
    - Basic Types
    - Polymorphism
    - Records
    - Variants
    - Rows and row polymorphism
    
* contraintes: prédicat(type, type, type, …) ou type ~ type (qui dit que les deux types doivent être unifiables), pas le même kind que les types
* typeclasses: (forall alpha, constraint(…) => …`
* Quand t'as ça, on verra pour avoir un first-class environment, ajouter le kinding, et quelques opérations de rangée

(** Syntax *)

expr(e) = 
  | value                             (* values *)
  | built_in                          (* built-in function *)
  | λx . expr                         (* abstraction *) 
  | ΛX . expr                         (* type abstraction *) 
  | expr expr                         (* application *)
  | { l_i = expr_i }                  (* record *)
  | { l_i = expr_i }.l_j              (* projection *)
  | < l = expr >                      (* variant *)
  | case e of < l_i = x_i > => expr_i (* case *)
  | expr as type                      (* ascription *)

A program can be seen as a list of expression. In Ligo those expressions takes any of those from :
- The ascription of a type to an expression which is an indication from the programmer of the type of the expression
- A variant element writen as above and the case block that adjust the control flow from the element's value.
- A record element writen as above and the prejection to get the element corresponding to the label.
- Lambda expression with values (λ) or parametric types (Λ).
- Application of an expression to another expression.
- Built-in fonction (mostly imported from libraries).
- A value, as described below.

value(v) =
  | b                 (* instance of an element in B *)
  | λx . expr         (* abstraction value *)
  | ΛX . expr         (* type abstraction value *) 
  | {l_i = value_i }  (* record value *)
  | < l = value_i >   (* variant value *)

Values are distinct from other expressions from not being derivable to another expression.
In Ligo values are :
- Lambda expression with parametric types or values that yield a value (contrary to the expression conterpart)
- Records or variants element define as above.
- Elements of Basic type (e.g. nat, bool, unit)

type(T) = 
  | B                (* Basic types *)
  | X                (* type variabe *)
  | type -> type     (* type of abstraction *)
  | forall X.type    (* universal type *)
  | lambda X.type    (* operator abstraction *)
  | type type        (* operator application *)
  | Πρ               (* type of records *)
  | Σρ               (* type of variants *)
  
The projection operator removes unecessary labels. Those labels are determined by the type system

Ligo is a staticaly type language using polymorphisme. Type can be any of:
- A "Basic" built-in type.
- A type variable which describe an undefined type for a polymorphic function
- An arrow type which is the type of a function or lambda expression.
- An universal type which is the type of a polymorphic fonction 
(example for the last three : Id: forall X.X->X )
- Lambda expression of type with parametric type. i.e. when given a type produce a type. These are called operators
- records of types that is use to type records (e.g. {a = 1, b = true} as type {a : int, b : bool})
- a list of types in "<>" used to type variant (e.g. <Tuesday=unit> as type <Monday=Unit | Tuesday=Unit | ... | Sunday=Unit>)

kind(K) =
  | *                (* kind of proper types *)
  | kind => kind     (* kind of operators *)
  | Ρ                (* kind of rows *)
  | Ρ((l_i))         (* kind of rows without label (l_i) *)

Ligo also provide higher order polymorphism. All types are given a kind, which are to types what 
types are to expressions.
Kinds are either "*" (the kind assigned to proper types) or double arrow kinds which are the kind of type-level operators (a.k.a type-level functions).

rows (ρ) = 
  | ( )           (* Empty rows *)
  | ( l = T | ρ ) (* Extension *)
  | (ρ1 | ρ2)     (* Rows concatenation *)
  | prj p         (* Projection *)

Rows lives at the same level as type but are member of the row kind. They represent list of string and types pair and are use to generate types
of records and variants.
There are few built-int operation on rows. Concatenation and projection. 
The projection reduce the fields of the rows to only those necessary in the context.
Concatenation unite the fileds of both rows into a single rows, these can leads to shadowing when fields are present in both field.
Extension are special case of concatenation

Γ =
  | ()         (* empty context *)
  | Γ, x:type  (* expression variable binding *)
  | Γ, X::kind (* type variable binding *)

Association between expressions and types, and between types and kinds are store in a context gamma (Γ).
This context can be empty. Binding between expression variable and type and type variable and kind can be added following the given syntax.

(** Evaluation **)

Evaluation rules define how expression should be derived in the language.

e1 -> e1' ==> e1 e2 -> e1' e2                     (* E-APP1 *)
e2 -> e2' ==> v1 e2 -> v1 e2'                     (* E-APP2 *)
In an application expression, the left expression is evaluated until it becomes a value and then the right expression is evaluated
(λx:T.e) v -> [ x -> v ] e                        (* E-APPABS-VAL *)
(λX:*.e) Y -> [ X -> Y ] e                        (* E-APPABS-TYPE *)
When an abstraction is applied to a value, the value parameter in the abstraction is replace by the value it is applied to
ej -> ej' ==> {vi, ej, ek} -> {vi, ej', ek}       (* E-RECORDS *)
In a record, the expressions are evaluated from left to right until each reach a value
e -> e' ==> e.i -> e'.i                           (* E-PROJ *)
{vi}.j -> vj                                      (* E-PROJTUPLE *)
In a projection, the record is evaluated first and the the projection is replaced by the corresponding value
ei -> ei' ==> <li=ei> as T -> <li=ei'> as T       (* E-VARIANT *)
In a variant element, we evaluate the expression inside the element.
e0 -> e0' ==> case e0 of <li=xi> => ei 
                    -> case e0' of <li=xi> => ei  (* E-CASE *)
case (<lj=vj> as T) of <li=xi> => ei 
                    -> [ xj => vj ] ej            (* E-CASEVARIANT *)
In a case construct, the variant element is evaluated first and the appropriate branch of the case is evaluated
v as T -> v                                       (* E-ASCRIPTION *)
The ascription is unecessary for evaluation and removed

(* The following rule implements observable equality on type constructors, other models of equality on
   type constructors might be preferable. The LIGO language currently only allows for built-in type
   constructors (list, map, set, and type constants like int or string which are implemented as 0-aray
   opaque type constructors), therefore the exact model of equality bears no impact on the type system
   for now. *)
