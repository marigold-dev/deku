# Getting Stated with Deku-C

In this 15-minute tutorial, we'll create our first Dapp for Deku-C.

You'll learn how to:
- Write a simple smart contract in [Ligo](https://ligolang.org/).
- Compile and deploy it to Deku-C
- Interact with the contract via `deku-toolkit` npm package
- Create a DApp using React Hooks provided `deku-toolkit`

## Our First Smart Contract

Let's write a simple counter, accepting the commands `Increment`, `Decrement`, `Reset`.

```js
type storage = int;

type parameter =
  ["Increment", int]
| ["Decrement", int]
| ["Reset"];

type return_ = [list<operation>, storage];

let main = (action: parameter, store: storage) : return_ => {
  return [
    list([]),
    match(action, {
      Increment: n => store + n,
      Decrement: n => store - n,
      Reset:     ()       => 0
    })
  ];
};
```

Refer to the [Ligo documentation](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/introduction) for

## Compiling 

```bash
ligo compile contract ./increment.jsligo
```
```michelson
