## Where are the example contracts? 
 They are in notes/smart-contracts/(dummy_contracts/lambda_contracts)

## How to originate them?
### example cli invocation to originate a contract:
 ```bash 
 deku-cli originate-contract data-folder wallet code.json initial_storage.json --vm_flavor=Lambda
 ```
### --vm_flavor=Lambda|Dummy: 
 argument itself is optional and can be left out, then it defaults to `Lambda`
### code.json:
   actual code of the contract, one of the files located at ./notes/smart-contracts/(dummy_contracts|lambda_contracts). For `--vm_flavor=Dummy` can be an empty *.json file as dummy vm has only one supported contract.
### initial_storage.json:
   initial storage provided for the contract located in the same folder as contract code itself and have a `contract-name_` prefix to them. If initial storage is not for the same vm_flavor argument provided to the cli an error will be issued. 
#### Note, current limitation:
   If initial_storage has the wrong type for originated contract, a type error will issued during core_state_machine transition and contract fail to originate without any notification to user.
## How to run them?
### example cli invocation to originate a contract:
 ```bash 
 deku-cli create-transaction data-folder sender receiver amount ticket --arg="example json string" --vm_flavor=Lambda
 ```
### --vm_flavor=Lambda|Dummy: 
 argument itself is optional and can be left out, then it defaults to `Lambda`
### receiver:
   Must be an existing DK1 contract address.
### argiment:
   Raw json string will be provided as an example in respective contract folders.
#### Note, current limitation:
   If initial_storage has the wrong type for originated contract, a type error will issued during core_state_machine transition and contract fail to originate without any notification to user. If initial storage is not for the same vm_flavor argument provided to the cli an error will be issued.
