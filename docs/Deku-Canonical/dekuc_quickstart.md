# Quick-start with Deku-C

In this 15-minute tutorial, we'll create our first DApp to Deku-C.

You'll learn how to:

- Write a simple smart contract in [Ligo](https://ligolang.org/).
- Compile and deploy it to Deku-C
- Interact with the contract via [deku-c-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@marigold-dev/deku-c-toolkit) npm package
- Create a DApp using React

## Installing the Tools

You can run deploy the contract in-browser without installing any additional
tools.

However, to follow along on along on the command line and to start developing
your own contracts, you'll need to install the LIGO compiler - check the
[installation instructions](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/installation) for your
platform. This tutorial requires version 0.53 or higher.


You can also deploy contracts to Deku-C from the command line - see the
[Deku-C CLI Tutorial](./deku_c_cli.md) for more.

## Our First Smart Contract

Let's write a simple counter, accepting the commands `Increment`, `Decrement`,
`Reset`.


```js
type storage = int;

type parameter =
  | ["Increment", int]
  | ["Decrement", int]
  | ["Reset"];

type return_ = [list<operation>,storage];

const main = (action: parameter, store: storage): return_ => {
  let storage = match(action, {
    Increment: n => store + n,
    Decrement: n => store - n,
    Reset: () => 0
  });
  return [list([]), storage]
};
```

Refer to the [Ligo documentation](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/introduction)
for more on developing with Ligo, and don't hesitate to
[reach out](https://ligolang.org/contact)!

## Compiling

Before a Ligo contract can be deployed to Deku-C, it must first be compiled to WebAssembly.

For example:

```bash
ligo compile contract ./increment.jsligo --wasm > increment.wat
```
In the case of our increment contract, this will produce the following
WebAssembly:

```wasm
 (module
  (import "env" "dup_host" (func $dup_host (param i64 ) (result)))
  (import "env" "pair" (func $pair (param i64 i64) (result i64)))
  ;; ..
  ;; lots more imports... truncated for brevity
  ;; ...
  (func $main (param $v1 i64) (result i64)
    (local $1 i64)
    (call $push (local.get $v1))
    (call $unpair (call $pop)) ;; implicit return
    (call $if_left (call $pop)) (if (then (call $if_left (call $pop)) (if (then (call $swap)
    (call $push (call $z_sub (call $pop) (call $pop)))) (else (call $push (call $z_add (call $pop) (call $pop)))))) (else (call $drop (i32.const 2))
    (call $push (call $zero)) (; 0 ;)))
    (call $push (call $nil))
    (call $push (call $pair (call $pop) (call $pop)))
    (call $pop))

  (export "push" (func $push))
  (export "pop" (func $push))
  (export "main" (func $main))
  (export "closures" (table $closures))
  (export "call_callback" (func $call_callback))
  (export "call_callback_unit" (func $call_callback_unit))
  ) 
```

## Deploying Our Contract

We can originate our contract using the Deku C Toolkit, a Typescript package for
interacting with deku canonical. The toolkit depends on [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/) for
signing interactions with Deku chain. Taquito provides options for using a variety
of browser-based and hardware wallets, but for convenience we'll use the in-memory signer.

```js
import { DekuCClient } from "@marigold-dev/deku"
import { fromMemorySigner } from "@marigold-dev/deku"
import { InMemorySigner } from "@taquito/signer"

const memory = new InMemorySigner(
  "edsk3ym86W81aL2gfZ25WuWQrisJM5Vu8cEayCR6BGsRNgfRWos8mR"
);
const signer = fromMemorySigner(memory);

const dekuC = new DekuCClient({
  dekuRpc: "https://deku-canonical-vm0.deku-v1.marigold.dev/",
  ligoRpc: "https://ligo.ghostnet.marigold.dev"
  signer,
});
```

With a connection to Deku-C established, we're ready to deploy our contract!
Try running the example.

```js live noInline
const params = {
  kind: "jsligo",
  initialStorage: 1,
  // The deku-c client will compile your jsligo code for you
  code: incrementLigoCode,
};

println(`Deploying contract with initial storage ${JSON.stringify(params.initialStorage)}...`);
dekuC.originateContract(params)
  .then(({operation, address}) => {
    println(`Operation successful! Operation hash: ${operation}`);
    println(`Deployment successful! New contract address: ${address}`);
  });
```

:::tip
In addition to using `deku-toolkit` and/or command-line tools, you can also develop Deku-C contract
directly from your browser with the [LIGO Playground](https://ide.ligolang.org/)!

## Interacting with our Contract

Once deployed, we can use the Deku-C client to query and subscribe to our contract's state,
as well as invoke operations. In the live editor below, we've hard-coded the address of a contract
on Deku-C, but you can replace it with the DK1 address of the contract you deployed above.

<!-- TODO: what happens when there are errors -->

```js live noInline
const myContract = dekuC.contract("DK1..."); // ðŸ‘ˆ Replace with your contract address

println("Getting contract state...")
myContract.getState()
  .then(state => println(`Current state is ${JSON.stringify(state)}`))
  .then(() => {
    // subscribe to changes
    myContract.onNewState((newState) => println(`Contract state updated, next state is: ${JSON.stringify(newState)}`));

    // Calling the Increment endpoint with parameter 3
    myContract.invoke(["Union", ["Left", ["Union", ["Right", ["Int", "3" ]]]]])
  });
```

:::tip

You can determine an invocation payload with the Ligo compiler:
```
ligo compile parameter ./increment.jsligo 'Increment (2)'
```
